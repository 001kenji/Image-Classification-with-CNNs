Image Classification with CNNs (PyTorch)
----------------------------------------

This project demonstrates image classification using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** in **PyTorch**.

### Covers

*   PyTorch Dataset and DataLoader
    
*   CNN-based image classification
    
*   Data normalization and augmentation
    
*   Training, validation, and testing loops
    
*   Metrics: accuracy, precision, recall
    
*   Debugging unstable training (overfitting, loss issues)
    

### Goal

Train and evaluate a CNN model to predict image classes and understand real-world PyTorch workflows.
